00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.874
Hi guys, how are you?

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.844
In the previous video, you watched Venilton,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.847
D.I.O. expert, author of this course.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.850
Now you will have a slightly different experience,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.853
but still created by him.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.856
The voice you are hearing was borrowed by Venilton himself

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.860
through an advanced technique of voice cloning.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.865
About my appearance, it is obvious that I am not a representation of Venilton,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:36.870
but I was carefully designed by him to co-create content.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.842
Our goal with this is to provide a unique educational experience,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:50.850
showing the potential of generative IAs like me in the teaching and learning process.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.855
You may be wondering, but after all, what are generative IAs?

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.857
This is an excellent question.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:03.863
Generative IAs are systems capable of creating, adapting and improving content

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:07.867
autonomously, always learning and improving.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:14.874
Think of a mechanism capable of generating images, music, texts, voices,

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.845
and even virtual avatars, like what you see now.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:23.850
All this with a quality that is similar to human work.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:29.856
In the universe of generative IAs, we have stars like the GPT model,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.859
the Generative Pre-trained Transformer,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.864
which symbolizes a true revolution in artificial intelligence.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:43.870
It stands out, especially when it comes to natural language processing,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.875
understanding, generating and translating texts with incredible precision.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.847
It is thanks to the GPT that we were able to transcribe and legendize this course

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:57.851
in three languages, Portuguese, English and Spanish.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:02.856
Thus, we are expanding our accessibility with concrete steps

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:06.860
towards a more inclusive education on our platform.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.864
Now that we know a little more about artificial intelligences,

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:15.869
it is worth noting how they are revolutionizing different sectors.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.874
From the creation of digital art to the driving of autonomous vehicles,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:26.846
these IAs are impacting various areas and, of course, education.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:32.852
Here at DIO, we are exploring these technologies to offer a more dynamic,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.856
immersive and especially accessible learning.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:41.861
The world of generative IAs is wide and full of opportunities.

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:46.866
We are still in the initial stages for the discovery of all its potential.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:51.871
So we invite everyone to join us on this fascinating journey,

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:58.845
in which we will explore some of the main practical applications of IAs today.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.848
Are you ready? Let's go on this adventure together!
