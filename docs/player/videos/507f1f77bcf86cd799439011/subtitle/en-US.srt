Hi guys, how are you?

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,844
In the previous video, you watched Venilton,

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,847
D.I.O. expert, author of this course.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,850
Now you will have a slightly different experience,

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,853
but still created by him.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,856
The voice you are hearing was borrowed by Venilton himself

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,860
through an advanced technique of voice cloning.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,865
About my appearance, it is obvious that I am not a representation of Venilton,

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:36,870
but I was carefully designed by him to co-create content.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,842
Our goal with this is to provide a unique educational experience,

11
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:50,850
showing the potential of generative IAs like me in the teaching and learning process.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,855
You may be wondering, but after all, what are generative IAs?

13
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,857
This is an excellent question.

14
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:03,863
Generative IAs are systems capable of creating, adapting and improving content

15
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,867
autonomously, always learning and improving.

16
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:14,874
Think of a mechanism capable of generating images, music, texts, voices,

17
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,845
and even virtual avatars, like what you see now.

18
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:23,850
All this with a quality that is similar to human work.

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,856
In the universe of generative IAs, we have stars like the GPT model,

20
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,859
the Generative Pre-trained Transformer,

21
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,864
which symbolizes a true revolution in artificial intelligence.

22
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:43,870
It stands out, especially when it comes to natural language processing,

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,875
understanding, generating and translating texts with incredible precision.

24
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:53,847
It is thanks to the GPT that we were able to transcribe and legendize this course

25
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,851
in three languages, Portuguese, English and Spanish.

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,856
Thus, we are expanding our accessibility with concrete steps

27
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,860
towards a more inclusive education on our platform.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,864
Now that we know a little more about artificial intelligences,

29
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:15,869
it is worth noting how they are revolutionizing different sectors.

30
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,874
From the creation of digital art to the driving of autonomous vehicles,

31
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:26,846
these IAs are impacting various areas and, of course, education.

32
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:32,852
Here at DIO, we are exploring these technologies to offer a more dynamic,

33
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,856
immersive and especially accessible learning.

34
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:41,861
The world of generative IAs is wide and full of opportunities.

35
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:46,866
We are still in the initial stages for the discovery of all its potential.

36
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:51,871
So we invite everyone to join us on this fascinating journey,

37
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:58,845
in which we will explore some of the main practical applications of IAs today.

38
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,848
Are you ready? Let's go on this adventure together!
