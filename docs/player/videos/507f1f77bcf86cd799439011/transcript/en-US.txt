Generative AI Revolution

Hi everyone! How are you? In the previous video, you watched Venilton, DIO's expert who designed this course. Now, you'll have a slightly different experience, but still one he created. The voice you are hearing was lent by Venilton himself through an advanced voice cloning technique. Regarding my appearance, it's clear I'm not a representation of Venilton, but I was carefully designed by him so we can co-create content. Our goal is to provide a unique educational experience, showcasing the potential of Generative AIs (like me) in the teaching and learning process.

What Are Generative AIs?

You might be wondering: "But what exactly are these Generative AIs?". Great question! Generative AIs are systems capable of autonomously creating, adapting, and improving content, always learning and perfecting. Think of a mechanism able to generate images, music, texts, voices, and even virtual avatars, like what you see now. All of this with quality resembling human work.

In the world of Generative AIs, stars like the GPT model stand out, the "Generative Pre-trained Transformer", which symbolizes a true revolution in Artificial Intelligence. It excels, especially, when it comes to natural language processing, understanding, generating, and translating texts with amazing accuracy. Thanks to GPT, we have been able to transcribe and subtitle this course in three languages: Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Thus, we're increasing our accessibility with concrete steps towards more inclusive education on our platform.

How Are They Changing The World?

Now that we know a bit more about Generative AIs and GPT, it's worth noting how they're revolutionizing various sectors. From digital art creation to financial forecasts, these AIs are impacting numerous areas, including education. Here at DIO, we're using these technologies to provide a richer and more diversified learning experience.

The world of Generative AIs is vast and full of opportunities. We're in the early stages of discovering their extensive potential. We invite everyone to join us on this fascinating journey, where we'll explore some of the main practical applications of AIs. Are you ready? Let's embark on this adventure together!
